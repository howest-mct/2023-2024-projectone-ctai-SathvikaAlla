# Tips for Feedback Conversations

## Preparation

> Determine for yourself what you would like feedback on. Write down a few points in advance where you definitely want to receive feedback. This way, the feedback conversation will be more focused and the questions you definitely want answered will be addressed.

## During the Conversation:

> **Listen actively:** Do not immediately go on the defensive but try to listen well. Show both verbally and non-verbally that you are paying attention to the feedback by maintaining an open posture (eye contact, upright posture), taking notes, nodding...

> **Take notes:** Write down the feedback so you have it later. Note the key words and find a quick notation method for yourself. If you take good notes, you can briefly review your main feedback points at the end of the conversation.

> **Summarize:** Do not wait for a summary from the instructors, this is your task: Check if you have understood the message correctly by actively listening and summarizing in your own words.

> **Be open to the feedback:** Do not wait for a summary from the instructors, this is your task: Check if you have understood the message correctly by actively listening and summarizing in your own words.

> **Think about it:** Consider what you are going to do with the feedback and follow up. Do you find the comments justified or unjustified? Do you recognize yourself in the feedback? How are you going to address this?

## AFTER THE CONVERSATION

> Reread your notes and create action points. Make choices from all the feedback you received: What can you work on and what will you set aside for now. What were the priorities? Review the assignment sheet again to determine your focus points. Write your action points on the feedback sheet.

# Feedforward Conversations

## Conversation 1 (Date: 29/05/2024)

Lecturer: Marie Dewitte

Consult:

Questions for this conversation:

- Question 1: Is it possible to have 2 different models for my project? If yes how would I connect them both?
- Feedback 1: Yes, it is possible. There will be a session about it soon. Think about how your skin type model would react to images with non-clear skin. Does it make sense for a picture of acne to also have a predicted skin type?

- Question 2: Any tips on how I could improve my model?
- Feedback 2: Improve normalisation, more examples(data), look for more specific examples (eczema).

- Question 3: Any classes I can include/exclude?
- Feedback 3: A healthy skin class is a good option; it’s always going to pick something so you need to definetely include healthy skin otherwise it’s gonna choose something else.

## Conversation 4 (Date: 05/06/2024)

Lecturer: Marie Dewitte

Consult:

Questions for this conversation:

- Question 1: I feel like I'm overly complicating my project by doing skin type and disease detection at the same time. The resolution and the type of input data needed Is it possible for me to only do skin disease detection?
- Feedback 1: Changing the PD now would be difficult. I'll discuss with my colleagues and let you know. You can still try to make them both work seperately with a toggle of some kind which is fine by me.

- Question 2: Running the model on the raspberry pi might be a problem as it lags a lot. Is this going to be a problem?
- Feedback 2: PJ can help you with , bc your sending every single frame through that’s why it takes long to process , make it more optimised but for further information PJ.

- Question 3: I'm not sure how exactly and on what we are being graded on.
- Feedback 3: Different stuff your handed in, creating rubrics on different assignments.Scoring is for everyone different, based on questions you need to answer. Not the accuracy alone, it has some weight but not all defining.

- Question 4: Is it okay if I use a video to demonstrate my skin diseases model?
- Feedback 4: video for skin disease is okay, you will need to able to programme that one is image and the other is a video. Or solve it differently than toggle  (creative).

## Conversation 5 (Date: 05/06/2024)

Lecturer: Tijn

Consult:

Questions for this conversation:

- Question 1: You mentioned that my nice to haves and must haves weren't clear enough in my maker skills document.
- Feedback 1: Primer and paints were listed as nice to haves in your document instead of must haves. You don't need to make any changes if you want to etch the text using a laser cutter.

- Question 2: Do I need to include my whole project kit in my plan for a product?
- Feedback 2: Not required, but you could do that.
